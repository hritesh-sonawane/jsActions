You may be asking yourself, "is JavaScript the only way to create custom GitHub Actions?"

Currently, there are **two** supported ways to create your own GitHub Actions:

- [Docker container actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-actions#docker-container-actions)
- [JavaScript actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-actions#javascript-actions)

### Creating vs consuming actions

Although we are going to focus on creating and consuming a custom action, in this course we will also be consuming some actions that have been made public to us. Because your workflows will most likely do the same, I found it important to show you where to look for actions that already exist.

After all, for each time we need to reinvent the wheel for our specific use-case there are a handful of times when we are better off using a wheel that's already made!
